# GAN-VAE_VoiceConversion
This implementation builded for VCC2020. Using GAN based VAE model. 

Voice Conversion using GAN based VAE model, which represent as the Generator in GAN.

We use the log(mel) feature for training. And the style of GAN is total raw way, without any 

transform as WGAN,SEGAN,MelGAN etc. 

As for the result, though it perform better than before raw VAE model, still not able to show perfect

in converting task.

The most important is not the result, but the polished coding way & enhanced coding ability.

Looking forward for better implemention for Voice Conversion task.
